##### Description

Designed to generate water at the initial stages and in hard-to-reach places without power supply.

##### General

The machine generates water without electricity depending on the biome in which the controller is located.

##### Water generation coefficient

Water generation coefficient = h. The ratio is changed using Output Hatch:

— Pump Output Hatch: h = 1

— ULV Output Hatch: h = 2

— LV Output Hatch: h = 3
