The mechanism allows you to store a large number of Data Sticks with recipes of Assembly Lines and supply them with these recipes.

##### General

Data Sticks are stored in Data Access Hatches (Normal, Advanced, Automatable).

The Data Bank communicates with the Assembly Lines by means of Optical Fibre Cables. In the Data Bank the cable is connected to the Data Bank Master Connector, in the Assembly line - to the Assembly Line Slave Connector. 1 transmitter can only be connected to 1 receiver.

For operation, the transmitter, receiver and the cable connecting them must be painted the same color. Optical Fibre Cables painted in different colors are not interconnected.

The Data Bank consumes 2,048 * (a * b + 1) EU/t,

a >= 1 - number of Data Access Hatches,

b >= 1 - number of Data Bank Master Connectors.

##### Important!

It is forbidden to dismantle a structure in working state to avoid an explosion!
