![LOGO](media/gregtech/LSC.png)

##### Description

The mechanism allows you to store a huge amount of energy.

##### General

Has no losses and does not require additional devices or mechanics to work.

##### Important!

Loses charge when removing the controller unit.


Can be 2 to 15 blocks high (not including 2 base blocks).


Has Energy Detector Cover support. The controller block must be in Normal Universal Storage mode.

##### Structure features

Inside the shell made of I-Glass, various capacitor blocks (Energium / Lapotronic / Mysterious Crystal Capacitor) should be placed. You can combine different levels of capacitor blocks. The number of capacitor blocks must be divisible by 9, i.e. you can not leave empty spaces.


Below (at the base) you can place Energy and Dynamo Hatch of different levels.
