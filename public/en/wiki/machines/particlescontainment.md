##### Description

The machine fills special containers with stable matrix particles. Requires low gravity.

##### General

The stable particle beam from Matrix Particles Stabilizer should enter the I-Glass on the left.

The distance to the Matrix Particles Stabilizer should not exceed 30 blocks.


Can accumulate up to 100,000 of stable particles. Fills 8 Empty Portable Cells with Matrix Particles per second, each containing 1,000 particles.


Beam does no damage.

Constantly consumpes 1,920 EU/t electricity.

##### Structure features

The color of the I-Glass in the structure does not matter.
