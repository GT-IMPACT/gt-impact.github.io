![LOGO](media/gregtech/AdvPyrolyse.png)

##### Description

The principle of operation of a pyrolysis oven is based on the thermal decomposition of organic substances into pyrolysis gases and solid residues.

##### General

The advanced Pyrolysis Oven differs from the conventional Pyrolysis Oven in that it is parallel (several recipes are executed at the same time).

##### Principle of operation

Principle of operation: During («Time») of the recipe, gases and solid fuels are released:

— At 7 seconds — Carbon Monoxide (72L)

— At 14 seconds — Hydrogen Gas (288L)

— At 21 seconds — Methane Gas (144L)

— At 28 seconds — CO2 Gas (216L)

— At 35 seconds — Wood Tar (1440L) and Charcoal (x5)

##### Important!

The machine, depending on the tier Energy Hatch, performs several recipes at a time (LV — 2x, MV — 4x, HV — 6x .. Tier * 2)

##### Energy consumption

EU / t = EU / t (prescription) * number of concurrent recipes * Energy Hatch tier / 2
