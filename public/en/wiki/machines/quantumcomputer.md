### QUANTUM COMPUTER

##### Description

The mechanism is needed to provide the Research station with computation.

##### General

The quantum computer communicates with the research station via Optical Fiber Cable. In the station the cable is connected to the data receiver (Optical Slave Connector), in the computer to the data transmitter (Optical Master Connector). 1 transmitter can only be connected to 1 receiver. If several quantum computers are to be connected to the station, they can be connected in series by installing receivers in them.

The circuits that provide computing and the heat vents that cool them are placed in computer racks. Depending on the number of racks needed, you can change the length of the computer from 4 to 16 blocks. Different circuits provide different numbers of computatuon per second.

When the computer is running, the racks with the circuits get hot. If an unbalanced cooling scheme is selected, then when the rack heats up to over 60% of the critical temperature, the circuits in the rack will burn out and the rack will begin to cool down.

##### Energy consumption

A quantum computer consumes 524,288 * (1 + n) EU/t,

n - number of racks with circuits (empty racks do not consume energy)

##### Structure Features

The blocks in front of the Computer Heat Vents must be empty.

##### Important!

It is forbidden to dismantle a structure in working state to avoid an explosion!

##### Uncertainty resolving

You just need to balance the lights around the focal points in the uncertainty hatch. There are 9 focal points in total, active ones are either green or red, you don't need to balance inactive ones.

If you take a closer look at the LEDs you will notice that they have 2 shades on their surface. Darker color denotes the affected area by the focal point. Only that area needs to be balanced on top of the focal point to satisfy it.

Buttons on the sides are used to pickup and replace 2 uncertain values.

Uncertainty Resolver X resolves uncertainty automatically.

In the example i have highlighted the effect range of 2 focal points:
