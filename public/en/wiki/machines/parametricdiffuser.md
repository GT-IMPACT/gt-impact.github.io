### PARAMETRIC DIFFUSER

![LOGO](media/gregtech/MATRIXDIFFUSER.png)

##### Description

The machine is needed to generate a beam of unstable matrix particles. Requires low gravity.

##### General

In Input Bus next to the controller you must put any Exquisite gem.

The power of the beam depends on tier of Energy hatch: (tier - 3) * random(200).

The higher the power of the beam, the faster the accumulation of particles in the next machine - Matrix Particles Stabilizer.

The distance to the Matrix Particles Stabilizer must not exceed 30 blocks.


The beam must be directed to the I-glass on the left side of the Matrix Particles Stabilizer. The beam does not deal damage.

##### Structure features

The color of the I-Glass in the structure does not matter.
